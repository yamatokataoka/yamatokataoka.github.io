      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a software engineer at Yahoo Japan. I recently joined the
        company as a backend developer for an advertisement system with Golang.
        Currently, I&apos;m insterested in the intersection of software
        engineering, deep reinforcement learning and Human Computer Interaction.

        I became interested in AI safety through 80,000 Hours when I was working
        a software engineer and thinking about my future career. And I continued
        to read some AI value alignment papers. Now my current research interest
        is aligning AI systems with human preferences to enable AI to work with,
        around, and in support of people. For sophisticated RL systems to
        interact usefully with real-world environments, it is important to
        explore goals defined in terms of human preferences to communicate
        complex goals to these systems.

        From the time I met AI alignment, the idea of helping others has changed
        as a software engineer. I was always thinking better interfaces and
        backend systems is only way to help to improve their life but now I
        realised that there is another strong system I can contribute to, AI
        systems. I would like to align AI systems with human preferences to
        empower individuals to thrive in their life.
